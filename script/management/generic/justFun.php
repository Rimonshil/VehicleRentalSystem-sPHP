echo "A genie appears and grants them one wish each.

The first says
\"Make a huge hunk of meat fall from the sky in front of me.\"
The genie clicks his finger and it happens. The first T-Rex begins eating happily.

Thinking of the possibilities the second T-Rex yells
\"Make a shower of meat all over the place.\"
Again the genie clicks his finger and it begins showering small chunks of meat which the second T-Rex begins snatching up.


The third T-Rex, not satisfied, roars
\"Make the same as the last one, but make it a MEATIER SHOWER!\"
